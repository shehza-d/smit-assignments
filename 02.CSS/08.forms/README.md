**Question:**

You've been tasked with creating a registration form for a website. This form should collect the user's name, email address, password, and allow them to select their gender. Your goal is to make the form visually appealing and user-friendly.

1. Create the HTML structure for the registration form. Include fields for the user's name, email address, password, and gender. Ensure that the form has a submit button.

2. Style the text input fields:

   - Set the font size for all text input fields to 16 pixels.
   - Add a subtle background color (#f2f2f2).
   - Apply a 1-pixel solid border with a light gray color (#dcdcdc).
   - Add a 4-pixel border radius to round the corners.
   - Implement a hover effect: Change the background color to a slightly darker gray (#b0b0b0).

3. Style the submit button:

   - Apply a gradient background using CSS linear gradients with the colors #3498db and #2980b9.
   - Set the text color to white (#ffffff).
   - Add padding and margin to make the button visually appealing.

4. Apply focus styles:

   - When a user clicks on an input field, change the border color to a vibrant blue (#3498db).
   - Ensure that the user can easily identify the focused input field.

5. Implement a cursor style change:

   - Change the cursor style to "pointer" for clickable elements (submit button).

6. Ensure proper alignment and spacing for a clean and user-friendly design.

**Bonus (Optional):**

- Add a background image of your choice to the text input fields and adjust the background size to enhance the visual appeal.
