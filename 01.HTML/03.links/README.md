# **Practice Question: HTML Text Markup, Lists, and Links Mastery**

This exercise will evaluate your proficiency in text markup, lists, and links within HTML. Be sure to rigorously test the links section with various scenarios. Follow the instructions below to structure and format the provided content:

1. Set the document title as "Text Markup, Lists, and Links Challenge."

2. Begin with a heading "Exploring the World of Literature."

3. Write a paragraph describing the impact of classic novels on literature. Use the `<strong>` tag to emphasize the book titles and the `<em>` tag to highlight their themes.

4. Organize a list of classic novels with their authors in an ordered list (`<ol>`):

   1. "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen
   1. "1984" by George Orwell
   1. "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee
   1. "Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville
   1. "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald

5. In a new paragraph, provide a quote about the magic of reading using the `<blockquote>` tag. Include a `<cite>` element to attribute the quote to its author.

6. Write a bullet-point list using the `<ul>` tag to enumerate the benefits of exploring literary classics.

7. Create a subheading "Dive Deeper into Literature" using appropriate heading tags.

8. Rigorously test the links using the following:

   - Link the title of "Pride and Prejudice" to a separate HTML page named "pride-prejudice.html."
   - Create an email link with the text "Contact us" that links to "mailto:info@example.com."
   - Link "1984" to an external website: "https://www.example.com/1984-summary."
   - Link "To Kill a Mockingbird" to a relative link within a folder: "books/to-kill-mockingbird.html."
   - Create a link with the text "Jump to top" that links to the same page, using the appropriate anchor.

Ensure your HTML document is well-structured and employs suitable text markup, list, and link tags for each requirement. Validate your document in a web browser to confirm that the elements are accurately displayed and formatted.

Challenge yourself by effectively using text markup, comprehensive lists, and rigorous link testing to communicate information and enhance user experience.
